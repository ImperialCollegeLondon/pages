				<h2>Code Structure</h2>
				<p class="lead">The PhyloCanvas code is Object-oriented and uses the prototype
					of a JavaScript "class" to describe the class functions.<p>

				<p>As well as providing an organisational structure for the code, using
				the prototype means that the code for the functions isn't copied into memory
				for each instance of PhyloCanvas.</p>

				<h3>Classes</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt>Branch</dt>
						<dd>Describes an individual branch in the tree</dd>
					<dt>Loader <i>(deprecated)</i></dt>
						<dd>Describes the "loading" animation</dd>
					<dt>Navigator</dt>
						<dd>Descibes the optional overview that shows the position
							of the current view relative to the whole tree. <i>requires work</i></dd>
					<dt>Tree</dt>
						<dd>
							Describes the whole tree object, as well as the functions related to viewing the tree.
							<i>Should possibly be split into 2 objects, the Tree and the Viewer</i></dd>
						</dd>

				<h2>Rendering</h2>
				<p class="lead">The rendering engine for PhyloCanvas is designed
					to minimise the amount of load that is placed on the client browser.
					As such the rendering events only fire when the user performs an action
					such as zooming or panning through the tree.
				</p>
				<p>The rendering itself is split into 2 phases, a pre-render to
					perform all the calculations related to determining the postion
					and layout of the tree, leaving only the actual drawing of the tree
					at the correct positon (offset) and zoom level. </p>
				<p>When a subtree of the main tree is redrawn from a branch or
				a branch is rotated the tree reset and then pre-render must be re-run.</p>
