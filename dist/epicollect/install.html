			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>The following installation guide shows how to set up EpiCollect on an Ubuntu server. The majority of the steps
			are the same on any platform, aside from the installation of the LAMP server.</p>
		</section>

			<h1>Step 1: XAMP Stack</h1>
			<p> In order to run EpiCollect+ on your own server you'll need a XAMP stack, in this case, we'll show how the
				server could be set up using Ubuntu. Other OSs need different processes. <a href="https://www.apachefiends.org">XAMPP from Apache Friends</a>
				can be a useful resource.</p>
			<p>The most recent version of Apache (2.4.x) is recommended, you'll need to ensure that mod_rewrite is included. Be sure to set a root
				password during the installation.</p>
			<pre class="code">
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install lamp-server^</pre>
			<p>Then follow the on-screen instructions. <b>N.B.</b> We have not tested with the Mac OSX version of MySQL since 5.1.x but at that
			stage there were significant issues with getting EpiCollect+ to work on OSX. </p>

			<h1>Step 2 : Configuration</h1>
			<p>Firstly the no-password access to the server from localhost should be disabled. </p>
