		<section id="intro">
			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>The following installation guide shows how to set up EpiCollect on an Ubuntu server. The majority of the steps
			are the same on any platform, aside from the installation of the LAMP server.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h1>Step 1: XAMP Stack</h1>
			<p> In order to run EpiCollect+ on your own server you'll need a XAMP stack, in this case, we'll show how the
				server could be set up using Ubuntu. Other OSs need different processes. <a href="https://www.apachefiends.org">XAMPP from Apache Friends</a>
				can be a useful resource.</p>
			<p>The most recent version of Apache (2.4.x) is recommended, you'll need to ensure that mod_rewrite is included. Be sure to set a root
				password during the installation.</p>
			<pre class="code">
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install lamp-server^
$ sudo a2enmod rewrite
$ sudo service apache2 restart</pre>
			<p>Then follow the on-screen instructions. <b>N.B.</b> We have not tested with the Mac OSX version of MySQL since 5.1.x but at that
			stage there were significant issues with getting EpiCollect+ to work on OSX. </p>

			<p> It is also worth setting up a PHPMyAdmin instance, as this makes the next step much easier</p>
			<p class="code">
				$ sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h1>Step 2 : Get the code</h1>
			<p>The suggested way to install the EpiCollect+ server is using clone the source code from GitHub. In the example below
			<span class="code">/var/www</span> is the root directory of the web server, you will need to change this according to where
			you wish to install EpiCollect+. You should also make sure whichever directory you clone EpiCollect+ into is empty.</p>
			<pre class="code">
$ sudo apt-get install git
$ cd /var/www
$ sudo git clone https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/EpiCollectplus.git .</pre>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h1>Step 3 : mod_rewrite</h1>
			<p>A rewrite rule needs to be enabled in order for the web server to correctly serve the EpiCollect pages. In an ubuntu environment the
				apache conifguration needs to be edited, normally found in <span class="code">/etc/apache2/sites-available/default</span>
			</p>

			<p>Under the Directory directive for the folder that EpiCollect+ has been installed to (you may need to add this if you're not installing it in the
				server's HTML root). The following lines need to be added</p>
				<pre class="code">
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/(ec\/uploads|images|js|css)
RewriteRule .* main.php</pre>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h1>Steph 4 : Permissions</h1>
			<p>the ec folder, and all of it's contents need to be readable and writeable.</p>
			<p class="code">
				$ sudo chmod -R 777 ec
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h1>Step 5 : Create Database and User</h1>
			<p>We need to create a database and user for the EpiCollect+ server</p>
			<pre class="code">
$ mysql -u root -p
mysql> create database epicollect;
mysql> create user epicollect_user identified by 'password';
mysql> grant SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, EXECUTE, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES on epicollect.* to epicollect_user;
		</section>
		<section>
			<h1>Step 6 : Configure</h1>
			<p>Open the homepage of your EpiCollect+ Server in your favourite web browser now and you should see a configuration page asking for
				the details of your database and user. After doing that you will be asked for the credentials of a user with full privileges to the
				database to create the database, these are used once and then forgotten. Finally you will be prompted to create your owner user,
				 and then login with that user. At this point installation is complete </p>
