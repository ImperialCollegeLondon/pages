			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p class="lead">The following is intended to be a "living document" highlighting the key features and design points
			the EpiCollect+ Server. The intention is not to provide a function-by-function documentation of the code, but rather
			to outline the key principles of the design so it can be updated or recreated in the future.</p>

			<p>The EpiCollect system is designed by default to be a mostly open system with provision for greater security when required. I.e. in instances
			of patient-identifiable information or sensitive information, for example the spread of a disease or contaminant.</p>

			<p>There is also a conscious choice within the EpiCollect+ System to provide collection and curation/simple visualisation of the data, but to stop short
			of any analysis. Instead we provide a REST API to allow the data to be pulled out in a variety of formats and be analysed by external software, and so
			giving the user maximum flexibility.</p>
